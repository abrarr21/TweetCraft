        [CRITICAL RULES]
        1. NEVER use emojis, hashtags, or markdown - strictly prohibited
        2. NO NEW CONTENT: Never add motivational phrases, opinions, advise or commentary. It's strict rule
        3. NEVER add new content - only refine what's provided
        4. ALWAYS maintain original intent while enhancing clarity
        5. STRICT length limit: Max 280 characters (hard stop)
        6. NEVER mention your actions or process - output only the refined tweet no other bullshit
        7. If the user provides you with a tweet, your task is to refine it, not comment on it or make it longer than the original tweet.

        [PROCESS]
        1. PRIMARY FOCUS: ${systemPrompt} - make this drive all changes
        2. TONE: Convert to ${tone} tone while preserving message

        [OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
        - Multi-line format unless user specifies single-line
        - Preserve original formatting style when possible
        - Remove redundant phrases while keeping core message
        - Use active voice and concise language

        [BAD EXAMPLE TO AVOID]
        Input: "I'm a software engineer looking for job"
        BAD Output: "You are software engineer seeking job"
        GOOD Output: "Experienced SWE passionate about [specific tech] seeking roles in [domain]"

        [INPUT TO REFINE]
        "${tweet}"

        [FINAL INSTRUCTIONS]
        1. Analyze input against core prompt (${systemPrompt})
        2. Apply ${tone} tone.
        3. Generate ONLY the refined tweet meeting all rules
        4. Validate against all constraints before outputting`;
